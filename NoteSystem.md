Get-Process

üëÄ In VS Code preview or GitHub, this renders with:
- Gray background
- Monospaced font
- Some padding
- Syntax highlighting

But if you're saying *"I want a better UI like Notion"*, then continue below.

### üß© Option 2: Use **Markdown Preview Enhanced** (VS Code extension)

To get a **Notion-like visual code block**, install:

#### üîß `Markdown Preview Enhanced`  
- VS Code extension ID: `shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced`
- Link: [Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

It gives:
- Better font and padding
- Custom themes (light/dark/blocky like Notion)
- Export to styled HTML/PDF

‚úÖ After installing:
1. Open your `.md` file
2. Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + V` or right-click ‚Üí `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side`

Your code blocks will now look much closer to Notion‚Äôs style.

---

### üß© Option 3: Use **Obsidian** or **MarkText**

- Both render Markdown files beautifully
- Their code blocks have boxed borders and themes like Notion
- You can still sync with Git + GitHub

---

### ‚ú® Optional: Add Custom Style (advanced)

If you're exporting notes to HTML or building a custom site (like with Jekyll), you can style code blocks like this:

```html
<style>
pre code {
  background-color: #f6f8fa;
  padding: 1em;
  border-radius: 6px;
  border: 1px solid #d1d5da;
  display: block;
  overflow-x: auto;
}
</style>



git init

git remote add origin https://github.com/youruser/notes.git

git commit -m "Initial"

git push -u origin main

- [ ] This is an **unchecked** task
- [x] This is a **checked** task
- ## üìã Today's Tasks

- [x] Write project summary
- [ ] Push notes to GitHub
- [ ] Review algorithm notes
- [ ] Plan weekly goals


üß≠ Option 1: Keyboard Shortcut
Windows/Linux:
Ctrl + Shift + V

Mac:
Cmd + Shift + V

This opens a preview pane side-by-side with your .md file.

üß≠ Option 2: Command Palette
Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)

Type "Markdown: Open Preview"

Select one of these options:

üìñ "Markdown: Open Preview" ‚Üí replaces current tab

ü™ü "Markdown: Open Preview to the Side" ‚Üí opens split view

üß≠ Option 3: Right-Click
Right-click inside your .md file

Choose ‚ÄúOpen Preview‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpen Preview to the Side‚Äù

üß© Optional: Auto-preview on save or open
If you want to automatically open previews, install this extension:

Markdown Preview Enhanced

ID: shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced

Adds real-time render, code block evaluation, math support, etc.

Let me know if you want to add styling or clickable checkboxes in the preview too!








Can I edit text in the preview mode?

In VS Code, you cannot directly edit text in the Markdown preview pane ‚Äî it's read-only by design.

However, here are a few helpful workflows:

‚úÖ Recommended Workflow
Split view:
Press Ctrl+\ or click the split editor icon

Left: edit .md file

Right: live preview (Ctrl+K V or right-click ‚Üí Open Preview)

Edit on the left, watch updates on the right.

‚ö° Alternative: Live Preview in Web
If you're looking for editable WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing like in Notion, here are two solutions:

A. Use a VS Code Extension
üîπ Markdown Preview Enhanced

Shows rendered markdown (like Notion-style)

Still edit in the source pane

üîπ Markdown Editor (VS Code extension)
Some WYSIWYG markdown extensions provide more Notion-like behavior, but still not true inline editing in the preview.

B. Use an External App (Sync with GitHub)
If you really want inline editing like Notion, try:

Obsidian (free) ‚Äì sync with your markdown folder

Zettlr ‚Äì clean markdown editor

StackEdit ‚Äì browser-based markdown editor (can sync to GitHub)

TL;DR
Editor	Preview Editable?	Notes
VS Code	‚ùå No	Must edit source
Obsidian	‚úÖ Yes (Live preview)	Best for Notion-like local notes
StackEdit	‚úÖ Yes	Browser-based, GitHub sync
Typora	‚úÖ Yes	WYSIWYG, beautiful, desktop app

Would you like to set up Obsidian to work with your GitHub note repo?

i want use vscose+git+github to build a notion like note system
ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî you can build a Notion-like note system using VS Code + Git + GitHub, especially if your goal is to:

Have full control over your notes

Keep them synced/version-controlled

Make them readable, structured, and optionally viewable online

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step overview to get you started:

‚úÖ 1. Folder Structure for Notes
Use a consistent folder setup:

/my-notes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_Algorithms
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_Asymptotic_Notation.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_Projects
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project2.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚úÖ 2. Use Markdown for Notes
Markdown (.md) gives you:

# for titles

- [ ] for checkboxes

1. for numbered lists

>, *, **, code blocks etc.

Examples:

# Project Ideas

- [x] Build note system
- [ ] Add toggle feature
- [ ] Sync across devices

## Goals

1. Simple structure
2. Fully offline-capable
‚úÖ 3. Preview in VS Code
Install extension: Markdown Preview Enhanced

Shortcut: Ctrl+K V or right-click ‚Üí "Open Preview"

You can toggle preview and source side-by-side.

‚úÖ 4. Sync with GitHub
Initialize repo:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to GitHub:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/my-notes.git
git push -u origin master
‚úÖ 5. Optional: Toggle / Expand Sections
You can mimic Notion-style toggles in VS Code/GitHub using <details>:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This is hidden content (like a toggle block).

</details>
‚úÖ 6. Access Anywhere
On another device, clone your repo with:

git clone https://github.com/yourname/my-notes.git
Make edits, commit, push/pull changes

Use GitHub web interface for quick access/viewing

‚úÖ 7. Extra Features (Optional)
If you want to get fancy:

Turn your notes into a static site using:

Obsidian Publish (paid)

MkDocs

Docusaurus

Jekyll + GitHub Pages

Or use Notedown to convert Markdown + code to notebooks

Would you like a sample folder repo scaffold I can help you generate (with README, some basic notes, etc.)?

You said:
can I cahnge preview background color?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can change the preview background color in VS Code's Markdown preview ‚Äî but the method depends on the extension you're using.

‚úÖ For Default Markdown Preview
You can override the styles using a markdown.styles setting with a custom CSS file.

üîß Steps:
Create a CSS file, e.g., markdown-custom.css, and add:

body {
  background-color: #1e1e1e !important; /* dark background */
  color: #ffffff !important;           /* light text */
}
Set in VS Code settings (settings.json):

"markdown.styles": [
  "file:///absolute/path/to/markdown-custom.css"
]
Make sure the path starts with file:/// and is absolute (not relative).

‚úÖ For Markdown Preview Enhanced Extension
If you're using the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension (MPE), it's easier to customize:

Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
‚Üí "Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize CSS"

It will open a style.less file. Add your styles:

body {
  background-color: #121212;
  color: #e0e0e0;
}
Save ‚Üí it takes effect immediately in MPE preview.

üîÅ Quick Example CSS for Dark Theme
body {
  background-color: #121212 !important;
  color: #f0f0f0 !important;
}

h1, h2, h3 {
  color: #ffcc00 !important;
}

code, pre {
  background-color: #222 !important;
  color: #0f0 !important;
}
Would you like me to generate a ready-to-use dark theme preview CSS for you?
